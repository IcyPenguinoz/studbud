# Studbud -  Iteration and Improvement

This README text document will go through the reflection I had underwent through the different iteration stages and how it helped to improve my web application - incorporating feedback and using my own reflection/judgement to see through changes.

Home Page/Overall Layout:

In comparison to the old mockup - the current and final version shown uses a better bolder font alongside mainly red, blue, green and gradient colours. Using these simple colours allows for a simplistic yet aesthethic look without being too overbearing for the user personas (Medical Student, Music Student, Computer Science Student) who want a simple, efficient yet modern style aimed to focus on improving their studying habits.

Task Management:

A very similar style was kept in accordance to the old mockup with the current version however due to the complexity of incorporating a smooth carousel slider - I had instead used the overflow css property which makes it very simple for horizontal and vertical scroll features instead of incorporating another module online which would save time and allow for more simplistic functionality which is easy to use and navigate through. A modal tab was also accordingly added to allow ther user to enter in their tasks in a manner that is easy to understand and allows proper user input. Given my self-reflection and feedback from the tutor on improving the modal tab - validation to ensure that users have included all details inside their labels was incorporated to ensure all fields were filled in alongside preventing spamming from happening. This validation was also applied to other areas where a modal tab was used in order to keep consistency and improve the user interaction with the web application. The incorporation of modal tab was also useful for responsive design as it can be dynamically changed with the width and height percentages to fit inside phone screens which is way better than my initial idea of having the task form beside the task box container which would be harder to alter in responsive design and not as sleek as using a modal tab which can be consistently used throughout other sections.
